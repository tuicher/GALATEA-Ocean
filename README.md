# GALATEA-Ocean
## Overview
Galatea-Ocean is a Unity URP project that takes you on a voyage through a stunningly realistic ocean environment. Inspired by the myth of Galatea and Pygmalion, the game features a sailboat navigating through a vast and interactive sea, complete with realistic clouds and a highly detailed ocean simulation.

## Galatea & Pygmalion
The name "Galatea-Ocean" is inspired by the ancient Greek myth of Galatea and Pygmalion. Pygmalion was a sculptor who fell in love with a statue he created, named Galatea. Through his love, the statue came to life, transforming into a real woman. This story resonates with the project's goal of creating a lifelike and immersive ocean environment.

## Key Features
### Ocean Simulation
The ocean environment is created using the technique described in Tessendorf's 2001 paper, which utilizes Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Compute Shaders. This approach results in a highly realistic ocean simulation, providing a captivating and dynamic backdrop for the game.

### Realistic Clouds
Galatea-Ocean's sky is filled with realistic, volumetric clouds that add depth and atmosphere to the environment. Players will feel immersed in the ever-changing sky as they navigate the ocean.

### Interactive Sailboat
The centerpiece of Galatea-Ocean is the sailboat, which players control as they traverse the sea. The boat interacts with the ocean in a realistic manner, allowing players to experience the thrill of navigating through the dynamic waters.
